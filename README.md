### As a client looking to hire a team of developers:

- I want to visit your site and see a navigation link for 'About, Team, and Contact' so I can quickly navigate to the areas of the site I'd like to visit.
- I want to be able to contact the developers by filling out and submitting a form by providing my name, email and message information So that the team have sufficient information to contact me afterwards.
- I want to click on a navigation link and a corresponding section be made visible in the browser window on the same page so that I can quickly navigate around the site without having to wait for new pages to be loaded.
- I want to easily view the site when browsing on my mobile, tablet or desktop so that I can understand the sites content easily on whatever device I choose to view it in.
